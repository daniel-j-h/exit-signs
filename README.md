Playing with Exit Signs / Destination Signs.

## Usage

Build the sign location extractor:

    ./deps.sh
    make

Grab some OSM extracts:

    ./osm.sh

Run the Sign location extractor on the extract and save out a list of locations:

    ./build/Release/exit-signs osm/*.osm.pbf > signLocations.csv
