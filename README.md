## exit-signs

Playing with Exit Signs / Destination Signs.

High-level idea:
Extract `destination=*` tags from OSM ways and query Mapillary to retrieve dashcam images.
Use these labeled images to train a model that is able to predict signs from unlabeled images.

## Usage

Build the sign location extractor:

    ./deps.sh
    make

Grab some OSM extracts:

    ./osm.sh

Run the Sign location extractor on the extract and save out a list of locations:

    ./build/Release/exit-signs osm/*.osm.pbf > signLocations.csv

Get clientId from Mapillary and use it to fetch images for locations:

    export EXIT_SIGNS_CLIENT_ID='YOUR-CLIENT-ID'
    mkdir -p signImages
    ./images.py signLocations.csv signImages
